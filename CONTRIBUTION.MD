# Contributing to Sonix Lyrics

Thanks for considering a contribution! This document explains the basics so you can get started quickly.

## Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
- Include clear steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual behavior, and any relevant logs (`sonix_lyrics.log` is especially helpful).
- Add environment details (OS, Rust version, build flags) to speed up triage.

## Proposing Enhancements

- Open an issue describing the problem you want to solve.
- Outline the proposed solution, alternatives considered, and why the change is valuable.
- Tag the issue so maintainers can prioritize it (e.g., `enhancement`, `good first issue`).

## Submitting Code Changes

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Run the existing tests or `cargo test` to ensure nothing regresses.
3. Follow the project style conventions (see `README.md` for any project-specific notes).
4. Commit with a descriptive message and open a pull request that references the related issue.
5. In the PR description, explain the motivation, summarize the changes, and list any follow-up work.

## Code Review Expectations

- Keep pull requests focused; small, well-scoped changes merge faster.
- Be responsive to review comments and update the PR with additional commits rather than force-pushing unless requested.
- When addressing feedback, note what changed so reviewers can re-verify quickly.

## Getting Help

If you get stuck, open a draft issue or PR describing the context and questions you have. You can reach out on Discord directly (`canadiangamer23`). Someone from the community will follow up when available.
